# Aravind Preliminary Task

## Task Description

  Glaucoma is a disease in the eye where elevated pressure causes eye damage. Due to the pressure, the optic nerve does not function properly and can lead to permanent loss of vision. However, the disease can be treated if detected at its early stages since the disease progresses very slowly. Current diagnostic tests are not the most efficient. The most common method used is tonography, a diagnostic test which records the eye pressure over a 4-minute period. 

  New research has shown that a diagnosis can be made by just using the fundus image using deep learning algorithms. Good results have been produced, however, not much research has been done which includes multiple sources of data. Limiting the dataset to one source can introduce bias and limits the number of images used for training. My goal was to create a model that uses data from several resources and create a full testing pipeline to perform a diagnosis.
